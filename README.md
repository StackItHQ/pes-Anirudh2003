# Superjoin Hiring Assignment

### Welcome to Superjoin's hiring assignment! üöÄ

### Objective
Build a solution that enables real-time synchronization of data between a Google Sheet and a specified database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). The solution should detect changes in the Google Sheet and update the database accordingly, and vice versa.

### Problem Statement
Many businesses use Google Sheets for collaborative data management and databases for more robust and scalable data storage. However, keeping the data synchronised between Google Sheets and databases is often a manual and error-prone process. Your task is to develop a solution that automates this synchronisation, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other in real-time.

### Requirements:
1. Real-time Synchronisation
  - Implement a system that detects changes in Google Sheets and updates the database accordingly.
   - Similarly, detect changes in the database and update the Google Sheet.
  2.	CRUD Operations
   - Ensure the system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both Google Sheets and the database.
   - Maintain data consistency across both platforms.
   
### Optional Challenges (This is not mandatory):
1. Conflict Handling
- Develop a strategy to handle conflicts that may arise when changes are made simultaneously in both Google Sheets and the database.
- Provide options for conflict resolution (e.g., last write wins, user-defined rules).
    
2. Scalability: 	
- Ensure the solution can handle large datasets and high-frequency updates without performance degradation.
- Optimize for scalability and efficiency.

## Submission ‚è∞
The timeline for this submission is: **Next 2 days**

Some things you might want to take care of:
- Make use of git and commit your steps!
- Use good coding practices.
- Write beautiful and readable code. Well-written code is nothing less than a work of art.
- Use semantic variable naming.
- Your code should be organized well in files and folders which is easy to figure out.
- If there is something happening in your code that is not very intuitive, add some comments.
- Add to this README at the bottom explaining your approach (brownie points üòã)
- Use ChatGPT4o/o1/Github Co-pilot, anything that accelerates how you work üí™üèΩ. 

Make sure you finish the assignment a little earlier than this so you have time to make any final changes.

Once you're done, make sure you **record a video** showing your project working. The video should **NOT** be longer than 120 seconds. While you record the video, tell us about your biggest blocker, and how you overcame it! Don't be shy, talk us through, we'd love that.

We have a checklist at the bottom of this README file, which you should update as your progress with your assignment. It will help us evaluate your project.

- [ ] My code's working just fine! ü•≥
- [ ] I have recorded a video showing it working and embedded it in the README ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- [ ] I have tested all the normal working cases üòé
- [ ] I have even solved some edge cases (brownie points) üí™
- [ ] I added my very planned-out approach to the problem at the end of this README üìú

## Got Questions‚ùì
Feel free to check the discussions tab, you might get some help there. Check out that tab before reaching out to us. Also, did you know, the internet is a great place to explore? üòõ

We're available at techhiring@superjoin.ai for all queries.

2. Approach: 
  - To setup a connection with Google Sheets I have used Google Sheets API
  - To have the synchronous flow from a Google Sheet to a SQL database i have designed a custom Apps Script code which does the following:
      - StartPoint: Logs a startup message (for debugging).
      - nEdit(e): Triggered on any cell edit, sends updates to the server:
                Row 1: Creates table or adds columns based on header changes.
                Other Rows: Inserts, updates, or deletes data based on cell edits.
      - onSheetCreate(e): Triggered when a new sheet is created, sends table structure (from row 1) to the server if the first cell is "id".
      - POST Requests: Sent to the server at https://your-url/ for syncing data.
  - To make this work, host you flask server on any public domain and use the url to send the requests.
  - To have synchronous flow from SQL to Google Sheets, I've in-corporated Google Sheets API for continuous update/insert/delete.
3. Steps to Run the Code:
  - setup a Google Sheets API service account and download the credentials and rename it to "credentials.json"
  - Open a google sheet and in the extension tab open Apps Script and paste the code from AppScript.js and setup a trigger on onEdit()
  - Deploy a Python flask server and use the code present in flask-server.py.
  - Now u can Update SQL from google sheets
  - To do the vice-versa process, create a python file where you SQL database is created and use the code from sql-sheets.py.
  - From this we can update the Google Sheets from any SQL updation.
